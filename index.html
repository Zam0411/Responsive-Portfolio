      <p>Hello, my name is Mauricio Zambrano. I am an aspiring fullstack web developer. I began my coding journey in August of 2018 when I heard about a bootcamp being ran by UCLA Extension. I have always been curious as to how a website is built and maintained so I applied for the program and got accepted.</p>

      <p>I began learning HTML and CSS once I got accepted in August of 2018 and since then web development has become more than a career opportunity to me it has become a hobby and a passion of mine.</p>

      <p>Currently I am knowledgable in HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node.JS and am currently looking into learning different languages to increase my scope in web developement.</p>
